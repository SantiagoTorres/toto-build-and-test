<Purpose>
  Provides a library of utility functions to be used in main.py. These include:
  countStr() which returns the number of times a certain substring appears in 
  a string gen_json() which outputs a dictionary to a JSON file, get_hash() which 
  generates an MD5 checksum of the file corresponding to a given filename, 
  write_to_file writes a given string to he file corresponding to a given 
  filename.
